# November Pirates

A Game for [Game of the Month 29 (November 2023)](https://itch.io/jam/one-game-a-month-29)

# How to play

Download the latest release from [itch](https://nhawdge.itch.io/november-pirates).

Extract the zip file and run the executable.

Note: Windows will most likely be upset about knowing nothing of the executable, you can safely hit more info, and then run anyway.
If you don't trust me, you can also download the source code and run it yourself with `dotnet run` or `dotnet build` and then run the executable in the bin folder.

## Controls

* W/S will adjust the sails
* A/D Turns the ship
* Q/E Fires the cannons Port and Starboard respectively (Alternatively use left/right arrows)

Special:
* F2 - Cycles through debug Mode
* F3 - Forces the wind to change (for debugging)
